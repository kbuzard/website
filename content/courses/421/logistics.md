## Course schedule

Professor [Leyla Karakas](https://lkarakas.expressions.syr.edu/teaching/) is teaching ECN 421 during Fall 2021.

I am scheduled to teach two sections of ECN 421 in Spring 2022. If history is any guide, the times will be Mondays and Wednesdays from 12:45-2:05 p.m and 2:15-3:35 p.m. with a Wednesday evening session for review and exams. I plan to teach entirely in person.

## Syllabus

See previous syllabi for an idea of the course format and requirement. {{% staticref "uploads/Syllabus_ECN_421_Sp20.pdf"%}}Spring 2020{{% /staticref %}} was the last time I taught the course in person. Future sections will integrate many, but not all of the modifications for {{% staticref "uploads/Syllabus_ECN_421_Fa20.pdf"%}}Fall 2020{{% /staticref %}}.
