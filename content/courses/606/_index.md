## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Who should take ECN 606?" >}}
ECN 606 is one of the two classes taught in the fall of the first year for the Economics Ph.D. microeconomic core (the other is ECN 611). It is meant primarily for Economics Ph.D. students, but others who intend to pursue Ph.D. level coursework in economics or related research may benefit from taking the course if their background in math and economics are strong enough to be successful.

Students who are not enrolled in the Economics Ph.D. program must have Professor Buzard's consent to enroll. [Contact]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) Professor Buzard as soon as possible if you would like to explore the possibility.
