## Syllabus

NEED TO MAKE NEW SYLLABUS

See previous syllabi for an idea of the course format and requirement. {{% staticref "uploads/Syllabus_ECN_421_Sp20.pdf"%}}Spring 2020{{% /staticref %}} was the last time I taught the course in person. Future sections will integrate many, but not all of the modifications for {{% staticref "uploads/Syllabus_ECN_421_Fa20.pdf"%}}Fall 2020{{% /staticref %}}.


## Course website

All course materials are on Syracuse University's [Blackboard](https://blackboard.syr.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp). Students gain access to the website by enrolling in the course.
