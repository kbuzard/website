abstract: "We survey more than 3,000 high school and college students across the U.S. to investigate the perceptions of the economics major by gender. Women report a significantly lower interest in economics relative to men, but this lower interest only becomes pronounced at the college level. We investigate potential mechanisms for the timing in this reduction in women's interest, including if and when they take their first economics course and how long they've been in college."

We survey more than 3,000 high school and college students across the U.S. to investigate the perceptions of the economics major by gender. Women report a significantly lower interest in economics relative to men, but this lower interest only becomes pronounced at the college level. We investigate potential mechanisms for the timing in this reduction in women's interest, including if and when they take their first economics course and how long they've been in college.
